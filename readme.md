git divides our work area into 3 stages: 
1. Working directory: Where we are creating and making edits to our files. 
2. Staging area: When the files are ready to be committed, we have to stage them first. 
3. Local GIt Repository: After the files are committed, they become a part of commit history in a local repository.
